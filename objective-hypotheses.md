# Objective and Hypotheses

## Objective
-  To help students from rural India learn computer science...
-  ...with an intuitive, strengths and interests based, hands-on, modular and adaptive learning methodology...
-  ...that gives them the confidence and competence to successfully start their career in computing.

## Hypotheses
1. Everyone should and can learn computing at varying degrees of complexity
2. English shouldn't be a prerequisite to learn computing
3. Knowing focussed skills within computing (e.g. Wordpress setup, technical documentation, frontend development) enables one get a job using that skill (one need not be an expert in data structures and algorithms, coupled with expertise in system design, with tens of internships to land a job)
4. Lack of clarity of core concepts in computing is what makes a fresher ineffective at a job, not their intellect or capability. 
5. Learning should be achieved in short spells.
6. Learning pathways should exist that adapt to your needs, strengths and interests.
