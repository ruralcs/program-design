# Scope and Anatomy of a Micro Learning Module

## Scope of a Micro Learning Module
A micro learning module is designed to impart a real world skill that can be immediately put to use on the job. 

There are multiple definitions of what comprises of skills on the job. 
- A comprehensive set of skills (including interpersonal skills) required for a job is provided as part of the National Occupancy Standards (NOS). For example, here is the Qualification Pack part of NOS for [Software Developer Product](https://nsdcindia.org/sites/default/files/TR-SSC-Q0501-Software_Developer__Products_.pdf). However, these qualification packs are not granular enough when it comes to specifying specific programming skills required to get a job. 
- A ladder of accountability levels is articulated part of the [DoNew Org Responsibility Stack]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnaM0rQbaa-1EfK9yC4GiB-NXNyZmHz4/view))
- A more industry standard articulation of a software engineer's career path is available at [Engineering Ladders](https://www.engineeringladders.com/). 

#### Skill ladder
At Rural CS we use the following skill ladder for programming (adapted from [Donew CS continuum](https://github.com/donew-innovations/moonshot-ideas/issues/12))
  1. can fix documentation
  2. can create documentation
  3. can fix minor bug
  4. can refactor small code
  5. can create minor feature/test
  6. can fix major bug
  7. can create major feature 
  8. can create new product/prototype
  9. can manage deployments and recover from disasters
  10. can architect horizontally scalable systems
  11. can create platforms

#### Programming ladder (specific to language)
A programming ladder is a natural incremental way of learning a new language. For example, [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) provides a set of modules for Javascript in increasing order of difficulty. This includes - 
  1. a basic level of - data types, basic control flow (if then, for while), basic functions
  2. and moderate level of - advanced functions (functions as values, call stack, closure, recursion), objects, keys, slice, map, filter, reduce, ...
  3. and an advanced level of - algorithms, caching, design patterns, introduction to frameworks

#### Scope of a micro learning module
A micro learning module scope is at the intersection of the programming ladder and skill ladder. For example, if you know the basic level of Javascript you will be able to contribute to documenting, fixing minor bugs, and potentially creating small procedural features without needing the knowledge of advanced data structures and algorithms. Knowing this should help a learner contribute to simple projects like [Github Quotes](https://github.com/shravan20/github-readme-quotes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
