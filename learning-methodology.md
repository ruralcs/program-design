# Learning Methodology

The learning methodology followed for Rural CS is a simplified version of the [DoNew continuum of learning-skilling-earning-centre-startup](https://github.com/donew-innovations/moonshot-ideas/issues/12). 

The Rural CS learning methodology is as follows - 
- **Learning Pathways**: The entire maze of CS is broken down into micro learning modules, interconnected in a dependency graph that enables infinite learning pathways. 
- **Next step**: Career success mentors guide the learner along their adaptive learning path, suggesting the next micro learning module they should take.
- **Cohort enrollment**: A cohort of learners enroll in a micro learning module to learn a particular skill
- **Micro learning module**: A learning module is conducted for 2 weeks and consists of four components 
    1. _Core concepts live lecture_: Core concepts are taught in regional languages using regional metaphors for developing an intuitive understanding of the topic at hand and crystal clear concept clarity. The session should also help build confidence that the topic is something they can easily grasp and work on. 
    2. _Self learning reading and exercises_: 
        Core concepts clarity is then reinforced by providing additional tutorials, reference links, best practices for self reading. 
    3. _End of module assignment_: Learners are then given an assignment to complete to check their understanding of core concept clarity. This assignment may be common to all, administered using Github Classroom with automatic grading. 
    4. _Real-world issue-commit-merge_: Learners are then individually assigned a unique Github issue to solve and submit a merged commit to. These would typically be good-first-issues from repositories from mentoring organizations or across any open source repo
- **Badge**: On completion of the real world project (merged commit) is the learner declared competent in the skill learnt through the micro learning module and is awarded a badge that can be displayed on their LinkedIn profile. 
- **Pay per commit assignments**: The learner may then be offered pay-per-commit assignments that can help them earn and learn.
