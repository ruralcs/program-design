# Learning Methodology

The learning methodology followed for Rural CS is a simplified version of the [DoNew continuum of learning-skilling-earning-centre-startup]([url](https://github.com/donew-innovations/moonshot-ideas/issues/12)). 

The Rural CS learning methodology is as follows - 
- The entire maze of CS is broken down into micro learning modules, interconnected in a dependency graph that enables infinite learning pathways. 
- Career success mentors guide the learner along their adaptive learning path, suggesting the next micro learning module they should take.
- A cohort of learners enroll in a micro learning module to learn a particular skill  (e.g. Javascript functions)
- A learning module is conducted for 2 weeks and consists of three milestones 
    1. core concepts clarity
    2. assignment completion
    3. real-world project completion
- Core concepts are taught in regional languages using regional metaphors for developing an intuitive understanding of the topic at hand and crystal clear concept clarity. Core concepts clarity is then built upon by providing additional tutorials, reference links, best practices for self reading.
- Learners are then given an assignment to complete to check their understanding of core concept clarity. This assignment may be common to all, administered using Github Classroom with automatic grading. 
- Learners are then individually assigned a unique Github issue to solve and submit a merged commit to. These would typically be good-first-issues from repositories from mentoring organizations or across any open source repo
- On completion of the real world project (merged commit) is the learner declared competent in the skill learnt through the micro learning module. 
- The learner may then be offered pay-per-commit assignments that can help them earn and learn.
